Before editing any HTML files, check if there's a `.tpl.html` file with the same name in the same folder. If so, it means that the corresponding `.html` file is generated, so you want to edit the `.tpl.html` instead (and don't forget to run `gulp watch` before edting OR `gulp html` after editing!).
